# pytwitservice

### Use Case:
Original Use Case was for a Twitter Handle that announced all food trucks in the vicinity.
Food Trucks would ensure they mention the Twitter Handle and also relevant street intersections.
Users that follow the Twitter Handle would be informed daily of the trucks that would appear as well as their location.

### pytwitservice Automatically Reads and Retweets Certain Tweets Throughout the day.
PyTwitService was a pretty simple idea. 
1. Business sends a Tweet, MENTIONING (@twitter_handle) Twitter Handle
2. PyTwitService scans all tweets that mention Twitter Handle.
3. PyTwitService performs additional logic to determine if tweet is relevant.
4. If the Tweet is relevant, PyTwitService retweets the tweet
5. Users see the Retweeted Tweet and are alerted of that Food Truck that day.
